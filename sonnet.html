		<p> From fairest creatures we desire increase,<br>
			That thereby beauty's rose might never die,<br>
			But as the riper should by time decease,<br>
			His tender heir might bear his memory:<br>
			But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,<br>
			Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,<br>
			Making a famine where abundance lies,<br>
			Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.<br>
			Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,<br>
			And only herald to the gaudy spring,<br>
			Within thine own bud buriest thy content, <br>
			And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding: <br>
			Pity the world, or else this glutton be, <br>
			To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.

			So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,<br>
			Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.<br>
			But if thou live remembered not to be,<br>

		<p> Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend,<br>
			Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?<br>
			Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,<br>
			And being frank she lends to those are free:<br>
			Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse,<br>
			The bounteous largess given thee to give?<br>
			Profitless usurer why dost thou use<br>
			So great a sum of sums yet canst not live?<br>
			For having traffic with thy self alone,<br>
			Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive,<br>
			Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,<br>
			What acceptable audit canst thou leave?<br>
			Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,<br>
			Which used lives th' executor to be.<br>

		<p> Those hours that with gentle work did frame<br>
			The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell<br>
			Will play the tyrants to the very same,<br>
			And that unfair which fairly doth excel:<br>
			For never-resting time leads summer on<br>
			To hideous winter and confounds him there,<br>
			Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,<br>
			Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:<br>
			Then were not summer's distillation left<br>
			A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,<br>
			Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,<br>
			Nor it nor no remembrance what it was.<br>
			But flowers distilled though they with winter meet,<br>
			Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.<br>

			With beauty's treasure ere it be self-killed:<br>
			That use is not forbidden usury,<br>
			Which happies those that pay the willing loan;<br>
			That's for thy self to breed another thee,<br>
			Or ten times happier be it ten for one,<br>
			Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,<br>
			If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:<br>
			Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,<br>
			Leaving thee living in posterity?<br>
			Be not self-willed for thou art much too fair,<br>

		<p> Lo in the orient when the gracious light<br>
			Lifts up his burning head, each under eye<br>
			Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,<br>
			Serving with looks his sacred majesty,<br>
			And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,<br>
			Resembling strong youth in his middle age,<br>
			Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,<br>
			Attending on his golden pilgrimage:<br>
			But when from highmost pitch with weary car,<br>
			Like feeble age he reeleth from the day,<br>
			The eyes (fore duteous) now converted are<br>
			From his low tract and look another way:<br>
			So thou, thy self out-going in thy noon:<br>
			Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.<br>

		If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,<br>
		By unions married do offend thine ear,<br>
		They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds<br>
		In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear:<br>
		Mark how one string sweet husband to another,<br>
		Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;<br>
		Resembling sire, and child, and happy mother,<br>
		Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:<br>
		Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,<br>
		Sings this to thee, 'Thou single wilt prove none'.<br>

			The world will wail thee like a makeless wife,<br>
			The world will be thy widow and still weep,<br>

			Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend<br>
			Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;<br>
			But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,<br>
			And kept unused the user so destroys it:<br>

			Which to repair should be thy chief desire:<br>
			O change thy thought, that I may change my mind,<br>
			Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?<br>
			Be as thy presence is gracious and kind,<br>
