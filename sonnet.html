<h3> 1 </h3>
<p> From fairest creatures we desire increase,<br> 
That thereby beauty's rose might never die,<br> 
But as the riper should by time decease,<br> 
His tender heir might bear his memory:<br> 
But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,<br> 
Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,<br> 
Making a famine where abundance lies,<br> 
Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.<br> 
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,<br> 
And only herald to the gaudy spring,<br> 
Within thine own bud buriest thy content, <br>
And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding: <br>
Pity the world, or else this glutton be, <br>
To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee. </p>

<h3> 2 </h3>
<p> When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,<br>
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,<br>
Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,<br>
Will be a tattered weed of small worth held:<br>
Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,<br>
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;<br>
To say within thine own deep sunken eyes,<br>
Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.<br>
How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,<br>
If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine<br>
Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse'<br>
Proving his beauty by succession thine.<br>
This were to be new made when thou art old,<br>
And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold. </p>
