 <h3> Sonnet 1 </h3>
		<p> From fairest creatures we desire increase,<br>
			That thereby beauty's rose might never die,<br>
			But as the riper should by time decease,<br>
			His tender heir might bear his memory:<br>
			But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,<br>
			Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,<br>
			Making a famine where abundance lies,<br>
			Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.<br>
			Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,<br>
			And only herald to the gaudy spring,<br>
			Within thine own bud buriest thy content, <br>
			And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding: <br>
			Pity the world, or else this glutton be, <br>
			To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.
