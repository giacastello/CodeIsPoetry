I was angry with my friend; <br>
I told my wrath, my wrath did end.<br>
I was angry with my foe:<br>
I told it not, my wrath did grow.<br>
<br>
<br>

And I waterd it in fears,<br>
Night and morning with my tears:<br>
And I sunned it with smiles,<br>
And with soft deceitful wiles.<br>

And it grew both day and night,<br>
Till it bore an apple bright.<br>
And my foe beheld it shine,<br>
And he knew that it was mine.<br>
<br>
<br>
And into my garden stole.<br>
When the night had veiled the pole;<br>
In the morning glad I see,<br>
My foe outstretchd beneath the tree.<br>
