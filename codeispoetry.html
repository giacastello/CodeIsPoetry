<title> The Poetics of Coding </title>

<p> 
A couple of years ago, Matt Ward wrote an excellent article for <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/05/the-poetics-of-coding/"> Smashing Magazine </a> dealing with this very issue. In it, Matt compares the structure, semantics and meanings of code and poetry. <br> 

He rightly comes to the conclusion that just <a href="apoisontree.html"> like poetry </a>, code embraces the constraints of its form to create a meaning that is both purposeful and consice. He especially emphasizes the importance of being structured in our code writing.

 <br>

Like a <a href="haiku.html"> haiku </a>, or  <a href="sonnet.html"> sonnet. </a>, programmers follow a set of standards that lead them to builds that not only follow a purposeful structure, but depend on them to function properly. 
<br>

<div> <img src="assets/pinkpixelsheart.gif" alt="pink pixels moving like a heart"> </div>

<br>
For those that don’t believe him, you need only to turn to Nicholas Gallagher’s Idiomatic CSS Guide to understand how welcome structure and meaning is to good programmers.
<br>

Still, I would like to probe this idea a bit further. Let’s take a look at one of the most basic code blocks you’ll ever see in WordPress: <a href="theloop.html"> The Loop. </a>
