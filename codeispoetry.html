<title> The Poetics of Coding </title>

<p align="justify"> 
A couple of years ago, <b>Matt Ward </b>wrote an excellent article for <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/05/the-poetics-of-coding/" target="_blank"> Smashing Magazine </a> <span style="color:black"> dealing </span> with this very issue. In it, <center> </center><b> Matt <br> compares<br>  the structure, <br> semantics<br>  and meanings <br> of code <br> and poetry. </b> </ins> <br> </center> 
<br> 

He rightly comes to the conclusion that just <a href="apoisontree.html" target="_blank"> like poetry,</a> code embraces the constraints of its form to create a meaning that is both purposeful and consice. <br>

 <br> <span style="color:pink">
 He especially emphasizes the importance of being structured in our code writing.
 <br> </span> 

 <br>

Like a <a href="haiku.html" target="_blank"> haiku</a>, or <a href="sonnet.html" target="_blank">sonnet.</a>, programmers follow a set of standards that lead them to builds that not only follow a purposeful structure, but depend on them to function properly. 
<br>

<div> <img src="assets/pinkpixelsheart.gif" alt="pink pixels moving like a heart"> </div>

<br>
For those that don’t believe him, you need only to turn to Nicholas Gallagher’s Idiomatic CSS Guide to understand how welcome structure and meaning is to good programmers.
<br>

Still, I would like to probe this idea a bit further. Let’s take a look at one of the most basic code blocks you’ll ever see in WordPress: <a href="theloop.html" target="_blank""> The Loop. </a>
