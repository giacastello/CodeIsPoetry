         <h1 align="center"> The Poetics of Coding </h1>
         <p align="center"> 
         A couple of years ago, <b>Matt Ward </b>wrote an excellent article for <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/05/the-poetics-of-coding/" target="_blank"> Smashing Magazine </a> <span style="color:black"> dealing </span> with this very issue.  In it,  Matt  <b> <br> compares<br>  the structure, <br> semantics<br>  and meanings <br> of code <br> and poetry. </b> </ins> <br>  
         <br> 

         He rightly comes to the conclusion that just <a href="apoisontree.html" target="_blank"> like poetry,</a> code embraces the constraints of its form to create a meaning that is both purposeful and consice. <br>

         <br> <span style="color:#FF4CD7" text-size=26px>
         He especially emphasizes the importance of being structured in our code writing.
         <br> </span> 

         <br>

         Like a <a href="haiku.html" target="_blank"> haiku</a>, or <a href="sonnet.html" target="_blank">sonnet</a>, programmers follow a set of standards that lead them to builds that not only follow a purposeful structure, but depend on them to function properly.

         For those that don’t believe him, you need only to turn to Nicholas Gallagher’s Idiomatic CSS Guide to understand how welcome structure and meaning is to good programmers.

         Still, I would like to probe this idea a bit further. Let’s take a look at one of the most basic code blocks you’ll ever see in WordPress: <a href="theloop.html" target="_blank""> The Loop. </a>
