<title> The Poetics of Coding </title>

A couple of years ago, Matt Ward wrote an excellent article for <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/05/the-poetics-of-coding/"> Smashing Magazine </a> dealing with this very issue. In it, Matt compares the structure, semantics and meanings of code and poetry. He rightly comes to the conclusion that just like poetry, code embraces the constraints of its form to create a meaning that is both purposeful and consice. He espeically emphasizes the importance of being structured in our code writing.

Like a haiku, or sonnet, programmers follow a set of standards that lead them to builds that not only follow a purposeful structure, but depend on them to function properly.

For those that don’t believe him, you need only to turn to Nicholas Gallagher’s Idiomatic CSS Guide to understand how welcome structure and meaning is to good programmers.

Still, I would like to probe this idea a bit further. Let’s take a look at one of the most basic code blocks you’ll ever see in WordPress: The Loop. All loops begin and end the same way (let’s ignore query posts for now). Let’s take the basic Loop from the brand new Twenty Twelve homepage modified a bit for simplicity.
